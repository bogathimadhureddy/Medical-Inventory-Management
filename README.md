# Medical-Inventory-Management

## Introduction:
* In the healthcare system, drug inventory management represents a significant portion of the costs, especially in the hospital supply chain to efficiently control and satisfy usage requirements. 
* However, the general healthcare system is faced with the challenges of increasing efficiency and reducing waste.
* First, the implication is that no healthcare facility is immune to drug shortages. Most hospitals have experienced drug shortage or have been affected by this in their systems.

## Business Problem:
* Drug shortage is always a critical issue of inventory management in healthcare systems since it potentially invokes several negative impacts.
* In supply chain management, optimization goes hand-in-hand with inventory control to address several issues of the supply, management, and use of drugs. 
* To avoid the shortage problem in a hospital, efficient inventory management is required to operate the system in a sustainable way and maximize the profit of the organization in the Hospital Supply Chain (HSC).
